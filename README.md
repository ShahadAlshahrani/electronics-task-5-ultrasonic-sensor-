##Ultrasonic Sensor
An ultrasonic sensor is a type of sensor that uses sound waves with frequencies higher than the upper audible limit of human hearing (typically above 20 kHz) to detect objects and measure distances. The sensor emits a high-frequency sound wave, which then bounces off an object and returns to the sensor. By measuring the time it takes for the sound wave to travel to the object and back, the sensor can determine the distance to the object.
Ultrasonic sensors are commonly used in a variety of applications, such as distance measurement, obstacle detection, and level sensing. They are often used in robotics, automation, and automotive industries, among others.
